      <p>My name is Jared DePalma. </p>

      <p>I am an aspiring web developer with a political science and economics background from Yale College. Immediately after graduating I moved to Denver, Colorado to pursue a career in research consulting for technology firms and foreign political parties in southeast Asia and the European Union. </p>
          
      <p> Ever since I downloaded my first mobile application on an iPhone, I have ideated about unrealized user applications that I believe can and should exists. I have a desire to work as a developer upon graduating from The UT-Austin coding bootcamp in July, 2020. Additionally, I will continue pursuing my web and mobile app developments that I have been passionate about since my first enocunter with an iPhone app and the tremendous inspiration it delivered me.</p>
